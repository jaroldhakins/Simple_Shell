This shell has the objective of recognizing commands and executing them from a standard input or from 
a path and also has two modes for its operation that are interactive and non-interactive mode

for the interactive mode we execute with ./hsh and it does not start with arguments and we also distin
guish it perfectly since the prompete appears as follows: $ JAC.                                      
                                                                                                      
such that the shell loops until the user interacts with the, and in non-interactive mode it is execute
d with the pipeline as follows: [command] | ./hsh ", it is worth clarifying that to use this mode we m
ust start with arguments.

In our shell, the commands that users enter are validated by passing through the respective functions 
as arguments. The first thing to do is check if the command contains a ./ at the beginning it would be
 executed as a relative path and if it begins with a "/" at the beginning this is dedicated to perform
 a function destined to execute paths,
